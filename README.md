### My Euler Project Sandbox

Here are some of my Euler Project solutions. Reminder that only the first 100 solutions are able to be
shared per the Euler Project: https://projecteuler.net/ <p>

>The rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems, as 
long as any discussion clearly aims to instruct methods, not just provide answers, and does not 
directly threaten to undermine the enjoyment of solving later problems. Problems 1 to 100 
provide a wealth of helpful introductory teaching material and if you are able to respect our 
requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed 
elsewhere.
